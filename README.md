## Hello! (Non-zesty version)


A quick overview of my unprofessional github profile.

- I'm currently working on a project i've named "Magnum Opus", for my undergrad thesis work in Mathematical statistics. The program is for me a "hyper"-structured way to implement the comparison and training (including hyperparameter tuning) of three CNN models, VGG16, ResNet and InceptionV3
- Apart from actively learning standard python practices i'm learning R and C.
- Fun fact: I enjoy coffee to a ridiculous degree.
